# House Prices Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution for the [Kaggle Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## 🤖 Model Approach
I implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict house prices. 
- **Preprocessing**
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor Model
- **Validation:** Used a train-test split to monitor Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE).

## 📊 Results
- **Kaggle Score:** 29371.88
- **Key Features:** The model found that `Overall Quality` and `GrLivArea` were the strongest predictors of price.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `housing-prices-competition.ipynb`: The main Python script used for training and prediction.
- `submission.csv`: My final predictions for the Kaggle leaderboard.
